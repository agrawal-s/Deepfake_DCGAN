    "\n",
    "The goal of GAN is to take a set of random input array and generate near-real images based in the input images. The generator component of the model creates the images from the input array, while the discriminator component tries to identify whether the generated image from generator is real or fake. Over the time, generator improves by taking the feedback from discriminator and modifying its weights and biases to make the generated images resemble more to the training images.\n",
